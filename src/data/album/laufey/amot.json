Laufey is truly one of my favorite artists with how she's taken a genre, that is most commonly attributed to older people and revitalized it for younger people.\n\nI love how *Forget-Me-Not* reaches into her Icelandic roots whilst staying true to her style, *Sabotage* brings an chaotic value to the album, and *Tough Luck* brings a rage-filled value that lets you just let out all of those feelings."
